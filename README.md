# Pentago-Swap
* An AI playing game "Pentago-Swap" with you.(Mainly using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm)
* Genrally, "Pentago-Swap" is a variant of the popular game "Pentago" where you are allowed to swap the board quarters. 
* I write a report so please feel free to know more about the ideas/algorithms of this project from that.
