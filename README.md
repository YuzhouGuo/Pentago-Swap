# Pentago-Swap

### General Info:
* An AI playing game "Pentago-Swap" with you.(Mainly using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm)
* "Pentago-Swap" is a variant of the popular game "Pentago" where you are allowed to swap the board quarters. 
* I actually write a report so please feel free to know more about the ideas/algorithms of this project from [here](https://github.com/YuzhouGuo/Pentago-Swap/blob/master/Report_260715042.pdf)

### Algorithm files:
* Find the files related to the alpha-beta pruning algorithm in src/student_player
* This is also the only files I edited, the UI interface was coded by somebody else

### A quick demonstration:

   ![alt text](https://github.com/YuzhouGuo/Pentago-Swap/blob/master/screenshot.PNG)
   * In this case, the white side wins since all five pieces get connected diagonally
   * All the moves (including swaping) can be seen from the bar on the right side
